# Super6502

## Overview

Super6502 is a microcomputer system powered by a 65C02 CPU. The goal of this
project is to create a computer system with modern features and the ability to
run modern software on an unmodified 65C02 core. While the project is almost
entirely contained in an FPGA, this rule is enforced by using an off the shelf
CPU.

## Goals

There are a few goals that I have for this project.

The number 1 goal is to create a pre-emptive multitasking operating system with
virtual memory.

I also have a few stretch goals:

1. Connect it to the internet

2. Boot linux (lol)

Along the way, there are a few milestones that I want to reach:

* USB support, including mass storage and peripherals
* HDMI Display output
* Ethernet

## Contributing

While I appreciate feedback, this my own personal project and I will not accept
external contributions.
